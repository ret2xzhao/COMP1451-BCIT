/**
 * This is a JUnit testbed provided to all students
 * to put BookStore and ShoeStore through the wringer.
 * The majority of the 'positive' marks for Assignment 1 come from the results window
 * that this module produces.  Compile the project and right-click the green TestAssignment1
 * box to "Test All".  For each test that fails, subtract one point from your grade.
 * 
 * It is possible that the module will not compile if you have a mis-named method,
 * or in the case that a constructor has the incorrect type / order of parameters.
 * You should change your code to resolve all errors since TestAssignment1
 * is an authority on how your classes should be presented.
 * 
 * Finally, be aware that a number of the tests will attempt to break your solution
 * by giving null as a parameter.  If you do not pass this test, it will fail
 * with a NullPointerException message and no other explanation.
 * The fix for this is to ensure that all Object parameters (String being a type of Object)
 * are not null before you do anything -- or write the code in such a way that null
 * is not dereferenced (IE your program doesn't try to call a method of null).
