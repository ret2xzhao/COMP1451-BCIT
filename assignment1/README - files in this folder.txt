Some students were requesting the layout that I had, and this file makes it available. [~James]

TestAssignment1.java IS a mandatory file.  Be sure to copy it into your project folder.  If your solution doesn't play nice with TestAssignment1.java, you should adjust what you wrote, to fit.

Finally, enjoy these pre-made Date.java and Weekday.java files.  Many of your classmates already created these files to solve Assignment 2 in COMP 1409.  You'll have enough work to do even if it doesn't include these! :-D
